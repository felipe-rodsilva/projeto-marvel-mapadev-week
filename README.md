This project was developed during the Mapa Dev Week, event held by @devemdobro. 

During the event, the developer twin brothers showed us the "map": what we have to do, what we have to study, and what are the best paths to become a developer.
They also taught us several important concepts of the HTML, CSS and JavaScript languages through this project.

I can say that I learned a lot at the event, because in addition to expanding my knowledge in these languages, the career tips will definitely be very useful on the journey!

This project is for study purposes, so all kinds of contributions are very welcome and appreciated! ü§ù
